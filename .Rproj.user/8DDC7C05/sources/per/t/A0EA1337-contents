```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## 1 Using the iri dataset

### 1-1 Get a subset with STATE_CODE 6 and SHRP_ID with 050

```{r 1-1}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
iri <- read.csv("data/iri.csv")
sub_iri <- subset(iri, STATE_CODE == 6 & substr(SHRP_ID, 1, 3) == '050')

head(sub_iri, n = 10)
```

### 1-2 Obtain the summary statistics of IRI of each section: min, max, and mean

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, 1-2}
sta_sec <- iri |>
  group_by(STATE_CODE, SHRP_ID) |>
  summarize(min = min(IRI), max = max(IRI), mean = mean(IRI))

head(sta_sec, n = 10)
```

### 1-3 Sort the summarized data by the averaged IRI in a descending order (report results for one section only)

```{r 1-3}
sta_sec_desc <- sta_sec |>
  arrange(desc(mean))

head(sta_sec_desc)
```

### 1-4 Generate a scatter plot for the averaged IRI against the time for a selected section, and then give your interpretation of the plot.

Firstly, select a section with a relatively large sample size.

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, 1-4}
iri_count <- iri |>
  group_by(STATE_CODE, SHRP_ID) |>
  summarise(num = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(num))

head(iri_count, n = 5)
```

Then, perform statistics for section:(4, 0215)

```{r 1-3-2}
iri_4_0215 <- subset(iri, STATE_CODE == 4 & SHRP_ID == '0215') |>
  separate(col = VISIT_DATE, 
           into = c("DATE", "TIME"),
           sep = ",") |>
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE, "%m/%d/%y"))

plot(iri_4_0215$DATE, iri_4_0215$IRI, xaxt = "n", xlab = "date", ylab = "mean IRI")
axis.Date(1, at = seq(min(iri_4_0215$DATE), max(iri_4_0215$DATE), by = "5 years"), format = "%Y")

```

The average IRI increased gradually from 1994 to 2004. From 2004 to 2014, the average IRI remained at a stable high level. After 2014, the average IRI gradually decreased. This indicates that the section experienced a gradual deterioration of road roughness in the early stage, which has been improved during the past 10 years.

## 2 Using the CRSS datasets in 2017
### 2-1 Get the intersection of the datasets accident and person
```{r 2-1}
accident <- read.csv("data/CRSS/ACCIDENT.csv")
person <- read.csv("data/CRSS/PERSON.csv")
vehicle <- read.csv("data/CRSS/VEHICLE.csv")

intersection <- intersect(colnames(accident), colnames(person))

print(intersection)
```
### 2-2 Tabulate the total number of observations in each injury severity (INJ_SEV)

```{r 2-2}
count_inj_sev <- person |>
  group_by(INJ_SEV) |>
  summarise(observation_num = n())

count_inj_sev
```

### 2-3 Merge the accident dataset with the vehicle dataset, and report the dimension of your results and number of missing values in one variable of the right dataset

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, 2-3}
library("naniar")
joined <- left_join(accident, vehicle)
dim(joined)

joined |>
  miss_var_summary()
```
